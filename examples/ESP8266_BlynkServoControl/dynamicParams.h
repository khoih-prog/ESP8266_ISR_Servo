  The ESP8266 timers are badly designed, using only 23-bit counter along with maximum 256 prescaler. They're only better than UNO / Mega.
  The ESP8266 has two hardware timers, but timer0 has been used for WiFi and it's not advisable to use. Only timer1 is available.
  The timer1's 23-bit counter terribly can count only up to 8,388,607. So the timer1 maximum interval is very short.
  Using 256 prescaler, maximum timer1 interval is only 26.843542 seconds !!!
  
  Now these new 16 ISR-based PWM servo contro uses only 1 hardware timer.
  The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
  Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
  This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.
  
  Notes:
  Special design is necessary to share data between interrupt code and the rest of your program.
  Variables usually need to be "volatile" types. Volatile tells the compiler to avoid optimizations that assume
  variable can not spontaneously change. Because your function may change variables while your program is using them,
  the compiler needs this hint. But volatile alone is often not enough.
  When accessing shared variables, usually interrupts must be disabled. Even with volatile,
  if the interrupt changes a multi-byte variable between a sequence of instructions, it can be read incorrectly.
  If your data is multiple variables, such as an array and a count, usually interrupts need to be disabled
  or the entire sequence of your code which accesses the data.
